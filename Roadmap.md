# Overview

## Problem statement

Over the years, I have developed strong opinions on building production ready websites that follow my 3F Principles: Make it Functional, make it Fast and make it Fascinating.  These, I believe, should be embodies in an opinionated starter project that will drastically reduce the development time of new projects by making the as template based and configurable as possible.
